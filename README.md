# Introduction
Hello guys! I'm nico (real name amber) and this is my Pheonix Wright: Ace Attourney inspired website. This is literally my first time ever coding so feel free to judge the mess of code that it probably will be. I'm using this project to learn HTML, CSS and JS because again it's literally my first time coding ðŸ’€ 

## Why Ace Attorney?
Ace Attorney is one of my favorite games as of writing this README (august 2025). The mechanics are very cool, artstyle is decent, funny dialogue and it's just overall a great experience. I'm making my first ever project dedicated to it solely because it has a very minimal layout and very simple mechanics and I thought it would be pretty easy to make. So far, I've literally strugged in every way possible though. 

## Struggles
I'm not even finished the visual layout and somehow I've already struggled for like 6 hours ðŸ’€ I'm very certain that I should've just sat down and learnt the 3 languages instead of googling every single thing because I've found like 20 ways to do everything. I've also switched methods after finishing the whole layout like 4 times I'm actually tweaking- anyways I'm kinda just not locked in (was gonna code but spent like 5 hours straight arranging music). Hopefully I can actually learn HTML CSS and JS instead of just balling my way through?
